AlbertaSatKOP: Software EPS simulation

Included Files :
* eps.c
* eps.h
* sc.c
* sc.h
* Makefile
* README

Makefile Targets for client:
* "make" : links all objects files and creates an executable
* "eps.o" : compiles eps.c
* "sc.o" : compiles sc.c
* "clean" : removes the object and executable

Running Instructions Combined:
In main directory that contains the Makefile, README and two sub-directories eps & sc type "make" into the 
terminal to create object files and main executable. After that type "./main" to run executable.

Notes and Assumptions:
Code was implemented to the best of my ability and to the best of my understanding
from the requirements given. For example for given requirement "d>" to handle non-normal states, the 
requirement states that under certain conditions the program must "cancel all threads execution for 10 seconds 
before beginning them again.". I achieved this by using the sleep() function, knowing that the thread function
was in possesion of a mutex required by both other threads. SO by using the sleep() function this blocked the
other two threads. I believe a similar effect could be achieved with condition variables but I felt that was
not necessary for this case, however I am not sure because the requirements are not clear if simply blocking
the threads is sufficient.
